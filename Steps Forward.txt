When going through the data per producer, we noticed that some of the results we got were not aligned with our initial expectations.
This is because studios often produce small video animations to produce their mainline series or to incentivize buyer to produce
the physical versions. There are many of these OVA's (original video animations) and ONA's (original net animations), and they
typically score worse than their companion mainline series due to their inherent commercial nature. Upon realizing that
these entries can disproportionately affect our mean, we decided to filter these short entries out. We did this by
multiplying their duration by their epsidoe count, removing all entries that are less than 30 minutes long.'


NOTE: the score statistics include everyone who's rated, regardless of if they finish. The 
other scoring stat only counts finishers

Interseting Point to compare:
Hypothesis: Some obscure shows like Gintama are only highly rated because the only people to rate it
are those that finished the show, and the only reason you would finish such a long show is because you
liked it.
