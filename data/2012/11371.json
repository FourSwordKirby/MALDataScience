New Prince of Tennis begins with Ryouma and his teammates heading to the U-17 Selection training camp, after receiving a special invitation due to their victory in the Nationals. The training camp is renowned for producing strong tennis players, so the boys of Seishun Academy can\u2019t wait to take their game to the next level. However, not everyone is happy to have them among their ranks, and they\u2019ll have to weather the intense training to prove they belong among the best of the up-and-coming players of their generation.", "score_8_votes": 4554, "users_watching": 1324, "score_2_votes": 51}
