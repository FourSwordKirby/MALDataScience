Upon quickly contacting the employer and learning that the position had yet to be filled, he applied without delay. The job was as a live-in servant at a mansion. His first day of work arrived. Upon arrival at the mansion deep in the mountains he was surprised by the size of the grounds and the palatial building itself\u2026 appropriate for the richest of the rich. The mansion\u2019s beautiful mistress and her equally beautiful daughters came out to meet him. However, within that day his expectations turned to bewilderment and then despair. By the time he learned the reason behind the high wages he was being offered for a simple handyman\u2019s job, it was too late\u2026 The work that awaited him was that of a \u201chandyman\u201d in name only. He joined several other servants at the beck and call of the mansion\u2019s mistress, tasked with pleasing every perverted whim of her odd family. Servants both male and female were unable to escape the mansion, forced to continually take part the unending bizarre play of the family\u2019s mad escapades. Will Yukito ever be able to escape the mansion alive, or\u2026.?! (Source: AnimeNation forums)", "score_8_votes": 227, "users_watching": 414, "score_2_votes": 33}
