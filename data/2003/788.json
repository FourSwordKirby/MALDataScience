Thanks to a chance encounter with the brilliant, beautiful, busty, but extremely shy Chiharu Shinonome, Eiken: Eikenbu yori Ai wo Komete sees Densuke being forcibly invited to join the mysterious Eiken Club. Led by Kirika Misono, she recruited Densuke both for his completely boring, unassuming nature and his completely accidental groping of Chiharu\u2019s chest. Despite the fact that he\u2019s now surrounded by insanely busty women, Densuke can\u2019t catch a break to save his life. All of his attempts to get closer to Chiharu end up backfiring, making him look like a deviant pervert. His situation is made more complicated by the rest of the Eiken Club\u2019s overly sexual antics and Chiharu\u2019s younger sister intentionally trying to get Densuke into some\u2026compromising positions. It doesn\u2019t help matters that Chiharu has expressed fondness for Densuke in return, but all of the accidental circumstances keep pushing her away. Densuke needs to act fast if he wants to find his way back into Chiharu\u2019s good graces. A beauty like her doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, and he may very well find that he\u2019s not the only one trying to win Chiharu\u2019s heart.", "score_8_votes": 540, "users_watching": 352, "score_2_votes": 1027}
