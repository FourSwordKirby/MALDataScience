In the 1920\u2019s, monstrous demons began appearing in surprisingly high numbers across America, manifesting as sin incarnate. To combat this menace, a holy organization known as the Order of Magdalene established branches across the country, all governed by the Council of the Catholic Church. The New York branch is home to the young and reckless Sister Rosette Christopher and her demon hunting partner, Chrno. Armed to the teeth with holy guns and bullets, the two are renowned for accomplishing their job, but also causing extensive property damage at the same time. This doesn\u2019t exactly please the head of their branch, Sister Kate Valentine, though Rosette is still greatly appreciated by the branch\u2019s minister, Father Ewan Remington, and their weapon developer, Edward Hamilton. Chrno, however, leaves them with a sense of unease; there\u2019s more to him than there appears to be, and even more behind the bond that he and Rosette share. Placing their lives in each other\u2019s hands, the two of them must continue to fight off the increasingly mounting demonic menace, discover its source, and hopefully complete Rosette\u2019s own personal mission of finding her missing brother, Joshua."}
