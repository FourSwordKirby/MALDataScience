Seemingly all of the girls want to have sex with him because the school only recently started admitting male students. Takuro seems like a normal student, but what the girls later realize when they try to take advantage of him is that he has a secret. Takuro has an \"Ultimate Sex Power\" that becomes the focus of St. Arcadia's sexual power struggle."}
