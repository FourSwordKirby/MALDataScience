YOU! SAY! ME!\" The animation takes Japan's 47 prefectures\u2014or more specifically, the local delicacies or famous landmarks from each of the regions\u2014and gives them a canine makeover. For example, the \"Fukuoka-ken\" (Fukuoka dog),\u2014Fukuoka of course being home to asianbeat HQ\u2014uses the delicacy \"mentaiko\" (spicy pollack roe) as the motif for its canine characterization. Each of the characters are played by voice actors that hail from each of the individual prefectures, \"Fukuoka-ken\" being voiced by Fukuoka's Kana Asumi. Another feature of this anime is the use of regional dialect. All the dogs speak in the dialect of their individual prefectures. So for the Fukuoka dog you hear a lot of \"~to\" and \"~to yo\" at the end of sentences; for the Aichi dog it's \"~dagane,\" and for Ehime, \"~zonamoshi,\" etc. (Source: AsianBeat.com, edited)"}
