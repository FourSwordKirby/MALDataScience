She is extremely reticent and her silence and habit of looking at people's eyes straightly sometimes cause misunderstanding.

The reason she rarely speaks is due to the fact she thinks too much before speaking, thus losing the timing to speak altogether. But she lives a happy school life with her classmates.", "score_8_votes": 1201, "users_watching": 625, "score_2_votes": 52}
