He discovers that the suave Subaru-sama, the bodyguard to the headmaster's daughter Kanade, is actually a girl. In exchange for his silence in the matter, Kanade promises to help him overcome his gynophobia.

With such a unique cast of characters, high school life in Mayo Chiki! is sure to bring about a ton of wacky adventures."}
