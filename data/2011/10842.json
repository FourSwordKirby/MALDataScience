In keeping with the spirit of Hiromu Arakawa's original manga and the two television anime, the interviewer has trouble early on in figuring out who the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" is. (The interview has cameos by the other stars of the anime.) Also includes 3 \"Study\" sessions with \"Professor\" Mustang, teaching Winry and Hawkeye about Creta and Milos."}
