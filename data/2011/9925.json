Fearing he might become a bum later in life and lose his job, she decides to stalk him to find out if there's more to him than what she sees at home. The episode is titled \"Imouto\" (Sister) and is available only on Blu-Ray in Volume 13 of the Amagami SS anime series.", "score_8_votes": 5170, "users_watching": 200, "score_2_votes": 37}
