Cient, the leader of a fortress city, sets out on a trip to excavate the lost technology \"Patia\" with his daughter Ruri. When Ruri gets separated from her father, a giant humanoid weapon of the old age attacks her. Ruri is saved by a girl named Tekuni who is traveling around the world training as a \"Wazabito\" fighter."}
