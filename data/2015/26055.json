Upon their arrival, the group gains a new comrade: Iggy, a mutt who wields the Stand \"The Fool.\" It's not all good news however, as standing in their path is a new group of Stand users who serve Dio, each with a Stand representative of an ancient Egyptian god. As their final battle approaches, it is a race against time to break Joutarou's mother free from her curse and end Dio's reign of terror over the Joestar family once and for all.
