What if someone, or something, was observing us through all our cameras and other digital devices for its own sinister purpose? Are there sinister supernatural elements at play in this age where people can\u2019t go one minute without looking at their phone? The series is animated using a technique called rotoscoping. In other words the animators are tracing live-action footage frame-by-frame to recreate it as animation. (Source: Dread Central)"}
