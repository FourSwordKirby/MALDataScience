The anime's story focuses on a pair of 16-year-old high school students who experience the Tohoku disaster and grow in the aftermath. Jun Agatsuma's father is a doctor, and she worries about the future. Kunpei Satou's father is a fisherman, and it was decided that the boy will succeed his father in the job. The pair's lives are suddenly disrupted when the 2011 earthquake and tsunami hit their area. The two determine their futures as Miyagi Prefecture recovers in the wake of the disaster. Three people connected to Miyagi Prefecture were chosen to voice the short's characters. (Source: ANN)", "score_8_votes": 10, "users_watching": 11, "score_2_votes": 0}
