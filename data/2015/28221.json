He wasn\u2019t warned, however, that the problem was a hole in the floor that leads to the realm of the zodiac gods. He also wasn\u2019t told about Nyaa-tan, the eccentric, immature, prospective zodiac-sign cat. Nyaa-tan would like nothing more than to join the rest of the girls, otherwise known as Eto-shin, in the Chineze zodiac, but she\u2019s going to have to fight to work her way in. Fortunately, establishing a relationship with Takeru can help her with that. In Etotama the members of the zodiac don\u2019t just represent people\u2019s births; they draw their power from positive human emotions in the form of energy called Sol/Lull. With this power, the Eto-musume, or potential Eto-shin, can change from their mostly humanoid appearances into smaller \u201cpretty modes\u201d that can battle with each other in the Eto world. Nyaa-tan needs to get Takeru to warm up to him fast, and not just because they\u2019re living together. The ETM12 selection festival to determine the next member of the zodiac is coming soon. With Takeru\u2019s good graces, Nyaa-tan just might be able to fight off the other Eto-musume and the 12 Eto-shin themselves, and finally take her place in the zodiac."}
