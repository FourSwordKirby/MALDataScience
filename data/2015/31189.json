Shiho discovers one of the school's male students hiding in her changing room locker with a camera, waiting for the chance to film her. Though he was bullied into the situation, Shiho is prepared to show him no mercy and punish him through the most pleasurable means she can think of. Saki on the other hand is committed to her boyfriend who has more than a little bit of a fetish for underwear. How will he react to the new competitive swimsuit that Saki is wearing though? A meeting on the roof of the high school will determine that, but there's the dangerous, yet tantalizing, chance that they might get discovered. When a high school has a busty swim team and an unofficial voyeur club, the combination of them gives you the events of Watashi ga Toriko ni Natte Yaru ."}
