Youtarou discovers that Makio is the only daughter of a wealthy family, and lives alone in the care of a group of maids. All Youtarou wanted was to leave his knighthood behind and start a normal life. But when he decides to take Makio under his wing, he becomes involved in something much bigger than him. Now Youtarou must defend Makio, without giving away the secret identity of the Knight Lancer she idolizes.", "score_8_votes": 1197, "users_watching": 3392, "score_2_votes": 682}
