However, he was finally suppressed by a group of heroes who took his powers and sealed him deep underground. Two hundred years later, there were rumours that the seal was broken due to the recent shifts in the Earth\u2019s crust and that the maou had been revived. Many confident adventurers descended on Astaroth\u2019s underground labyrinth with the intention of defeating him and becoming famous.
