He\u2019s used to being mistaken for a girl, but it\u2019s even worse when a captivating stranger on the train calls him a creeper for staring a little too long. Aoi\u2019s soaked by a sudden rainstorm and takes shelter at Rainy Color, a cozy caf\u00e9 where the warmth of the staff compliments the sweet hot cocoa he\u2019s served. When he falls into a job at the caf\u00e9 he feels like things are finally looking up\u2014 until Keiichi Iwase, the man he couldn\u2019t help but stare at on the train, shows up. Did this day just get worse, or better? (Source: FUNimation)"}
