After showing it to an audience at a culture festival, that pledge turned into a huge dream - to move to Tokyo, get jobs in the anime industry and one day join hands to create something amazing. Fast forward two and a half years and two of those members, Aoi Miyamori and Ema Yasuhara, have made their dreams into reality by landing jobs at a famous production company called Musashino Animation. Everything seems perfect at first. However, as the girls slowly discover, the animation industry is a bit tougher than they had imagined.
