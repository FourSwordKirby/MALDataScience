He even manages to confess his love. Too bad it turns out that Tatsumi is an aggressive, self-centered, and outspoken homophobe. Yet somehow Tetsuhiro managed to fall in love with Tatsumi, the \u201cwalking personality disorder,\u201d who is the kind of man who declares that all gay men should be wiped off the face of the planet. An unfortunate accident with an aphrodisiac drug brings the two men physically together against Souichi\u2019s will. The experience has a life-changing effect on both men. But will it ultimately bring them closer, or drive them apart?"}
