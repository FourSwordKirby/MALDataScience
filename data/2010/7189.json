The story is set in a certain neighborhood of Tokyo where two cats live under a kotatsu. Shito is a girlish white cat, while Zero is a cool black cat. The cat's owner, Rei \"Junior\" Fujisaki, is a third-year middle-school hikikomori obsessed with games. He likes a girl in his class, but naturally, he cannot work up the nerve to tell her. Shito herself harbors a secret one-sided love also. (Source: ANN)"}
