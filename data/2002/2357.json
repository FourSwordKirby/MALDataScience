Now he is in a new town with new women. He wants to have sex with them. He picks each girl up many times and follows them around. They do not seem to notice it's the same cabbie until it's to late, until he gets all his sources and starts to blackmail them. In his new town his first fare was Satsuki, a member of the archery club. He goes on from there to get twins, a swimmer, a cheer leader, and more."}
