The two tribes lived in peace and harmony, their domains separated by the \u201cWords Worth\u201d tablet\u2014a huge monolith slab erected by a guardian spirit. Although the tablet has writing on it, neither Tribe can read the text. One day, Words Worth was mysteriously destroyed by an unknown entity; its component parts scattered among the domain of the Tribes of Shadow. The two Tribes blamed each other for the tablet\u2019s destruction, and started a war that has been on-going for 100 years. Astral, prince of the Tribe of Shadow, desires to become a Swordsman of Shadow but his father, King Wortoshika, forbids him to do so. He is engaged to Sharon, a beautiful swordswoman who generally like Astral but wishes he was stronger. (Source: Urhentai)", "score_8_votes": 127, "users_watching": 91, "score_2_votes": 30}
