The year is 200X. Jin, Akira and Lena are three child hood friends who like mysterious things. One day in the library, along with the mysterious transfer student Ami, they find the \"Akuma Compendium\". They chanted an incantation in the book and, to their surprise, devils appeared. Ami then told Jin and Akira that they are the Devil Children that will decide the fate of the world. She hands them their Devil Risers. The group then pass through the \"Door of Time\" to the land of Valhalla where they fight an evil ruler known as Imperius who plans on conquering all of the world.
