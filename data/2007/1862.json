However, one man is able to lead the invention of an anti-Neuroi weapon known as the \"Striker unit\" which augments magical power and also enables flight through two mechanical lower-leg coverings known as a sort of witches \"broom.\" Young witches from around the world are gathered together to fight back in a force known as Strike Witches. The inventor, however, was thought to have been killed during service. The daughter of the inventor leads a relatively normal life except for her untrained and incredible magical power which she hopes to use one day in healing. However, she is suddenly whisked away on a search to see if her father is actually alive. She encounters his invention and the possibility of perhaps using it herself.
