The official announcement will be made in the September issue (on sale August 10) of Newtype magazine in Japan. The Gainax/Khara franchise spinoff spoofs the psychological science fiction drama by reimagining the characters as classmates in Tokyo-3's Nerv School, headed by Principal Gend\u014d Ikari and Misato-sensei. The student body includes three different Rei \"sisters,\" the EVA-01 mobile weapon reimagined as the school bully Evanch\u014d, and the ill-fated Jet Alone robot as JA-ko, a \"hidden character\" in the form of a shy android girl. Ryuusuke Hamamoto created the character designs which has inspired four-panel gag manga serializations in four different magazines: Monthly Sh\u014dnen Ace, Newtype, Dengeki Hobby Magazine, and Figure Oh. The Petit Eva project has also developed merchandising from super-deformed figurines to limited edition Doritos corn chips.\" (Source: MoonPhase)", "score_8_votes": 778, "users_watching": 479, "score_2_votes": 308}
