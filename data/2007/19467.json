Van is the prince from the now-defunct Revbahaf Kingdom, Kona \u2013 his hand maiden, and Sian \u2013 his philosopher and tutor.  Chased by enemies, these three individuals earn the kindness of Aaron, who feeds them at the cabin.  By helping out with Aaron\u2019s chores, the former royal family learns to live a peaceful life getting by, rather than plotting a revenge on the neighboring country which invaded them. Together they try to rebuild the Kingdom of Revbahaf. (Source: Manhwa101)", "score_8_votes": 1, "users_watching": 9, "score_2_votes": 0}
