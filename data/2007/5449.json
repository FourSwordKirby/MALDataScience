While testing the buttons, he accidentally transports the 4 tadpoles inside the ball. To get out, they must win the pinball maze. In the outside world, a young blue tadpole Kururu picks up the ball and hears the cries of help. He makes a deal to free those trapped inside if he gets a plate of curry rice. A deal is a deal and with the Kero Ball, a plate of curry rice is produced for Kururu. Unfortunately, the plate grows bigger and bigger and bigger. It got so big, that Kururu was immersed in the curry. The yellow curry slowly transforms the blue Kururu into the \"yellow devil\" and as the film is about to fade into black, \"Kukuku\" is heard.
