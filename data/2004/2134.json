There Nishino Purin, whom he had adored, was also working. Though he spent dreamlike days in which he was served sexual treatment by the cute clerks, it didn't last long. He knew another face of the A la mode, it was an organization to protect the Earth. To his surprise, they were the fighters who protected the peace of the Earth. They wielded the Kokoro-energy, which is the energy generated by putting their minds and Shuta's together in order to fight against the evil syndicate, Libido-Kingdom. Will Shuta and the Famires (short for Family Restaurant) fighters be able to save the peace of the Earth while dipping into this harem situation?
