Everyone looks up to Ayaka. She's one of the most beautiful professors at the academy, with bright eyes, big breasts, and a brilliant smile. But she's got a tough side, too: she's coach of the Karate Club. Treat her well, and you'll be rewarded with all sorts of sexy favors... but get on her bad side, and you'll be flat on your back in no time. So far, there's only been one guy bold enough to anger Ayaka: a brash new student named Togawa. One night, he finds Ayaka having a one-woman orgy in the gym shower room and decides to step in. Will Ayaka's temper flare up once again, or will she be swept up by her lustful desires?"}
