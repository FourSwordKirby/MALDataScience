Luckily, he has a job offer to be a teacher from a prestigious high-school. While Naomi indeed has a degree in teaching music, that's not why he is offered the job\u2014at all. Tokisawa Naomi is a renowned pimp and trainer of prostitutes. Though he doesn't simply break the girls; Naomi awakens their secret desires so that they are selling their bodies willingly. The high-school doubles as a modern place to train prostitutes for the country's upper class. Naomi has to train five students.
