Each pair keeps a few distance between their partners and find some fearful, tender, and comfortable feelings that fascinate them. The feelings are put into practice immediately, and they start groping each feelings. Somehow, I try to blend and connect them. \"Feelings\" are sound bliss for all who have a body and sense. I busily pick my feelings on the track of my life and reconstruct by animation to appreciate them.\" (Source: Yoriko Mizushiri)", "score_8_votes": 4, "users_watching": 3, "score_2_votes": 1}
