The anime will be on the Ciao Ciao TV bonus DVD that will be bundled with the September issue of the magazine on August 2. The story is set at the elite Omega High School, where test results decide everything. The high-scorers in the student council, in particular the student council president, have a lot of authority. Yuria Aikawa comes to this school, and though she seems like an ordinary girl who loves fun things and her boyfriend Shuri, she's actually a super-genius who gets the top score on every test. She becomes student council president and tries to make school life more fun in various ways. (Source: ANN)"}
