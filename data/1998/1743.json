Milk is poor and she can't pay the rent, especially after her attempt to extort a local ant family fails. However, she is saved because the president himself offers her a job (some sort of a secret mission). Milk-chan answers the phone to receive missions from The President by saying something like \"Hello, Bank of Hokkaido. Just kidding!\" After getting her mission, Milk-chan and her sidekicks take off aboard the \"Milk-6\" helicopter to go on her mission. Did I tell you this is a spoof of 1970s spy thrillers or some sort of Bond movies? (Source: AniDB)", "score_8_votes": 119, "users_watching": 48, "score_2_votes": 70}
