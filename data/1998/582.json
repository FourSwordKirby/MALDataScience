Masaru forms a club based on this art, including Fujiyama, who he nicknames Fuumin, in the club. The club becomes full of strange, yet wacky people. Aliens, moustaches, and cute fuzzy animals are encountered as the club moves along and gets steadily more popular. (Source: ANN)", "score_8_votes": 628, "users_watching": 446, "score_2_votes": 13}
