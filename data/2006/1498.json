The two quickly discover that the Kowloon Children who survived the Holy War are seeking to infiltrate the \"Special Zone\", a thriving city protected by an invisible barrier that will not allow Kowloon Children entrance, unless they're invited. Red Bloods refers to the humans; Black Bloods are the vampires, and the Mochizuki Brothers are Old Blood, the last descendants of an elite clan of vampires. When Kotarou is abducted by one of the Kowloon Children, Jirou has no choice but to fight once more. (Source: ANN)", "score_8_votes": 9594, "users_watching": 1879, "score_2_votes": 181}
