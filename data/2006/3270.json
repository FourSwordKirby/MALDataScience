The phenomenon is so big that an entire city was built for the racing industry where competitions take place on a huge track. In the \u201cImmortal Grand Prix,\u201d two teams of three IG machines, high-tech humanoid mechs driven by humans, race at speeds greater than 400km/h. The teams make three laps of a 60 km course while intercepting the opponent as they vie for a first place finish. The best machine performance, the best pilots and the best teamwork are the only factors that can make them the winners. (Source: Production I.G.)"}
