Even the inventors aren't sure of the true extent of the power of the DC Mini. Just imagine the world of good this kind of technology can do\u2026 unless it falls into the wrong hands. A prototype DC Mini has been stolen, and Paprika is on the case. It\u2019s up to this dream detective to track down and stop the thief through the psychedelic backdrop of people\u2019s dreams. Paprika will need to hurry, before the dream machine does some serious damage."}
