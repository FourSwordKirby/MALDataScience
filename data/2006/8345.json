Rarely seen without Deudeu \u2013 her favourite stuffed rabbit \u2013 Penelope likes nothing more than finding another adventure in the most unlikely of places. A simple gust of wind blowing her hat away can lead to Penelope running her own stall atop a tree stump where she trades flowers for apples, and paper planes for acorns. From games of hide and seek with her friends, to playing with the bubbles in the bath or counting sheep during nap time, Penelope\u2019s life is never dull \u2013 even if she does wear odd socks when she gets herself dressed in the morning.
