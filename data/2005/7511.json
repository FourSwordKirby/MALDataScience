When he opens it he finds a rundown and rather spooky city made up of large tower block apartments. Suddenly a mysterious ghostly stick entity appears and seems to follow our hero. What is the purpose of this strange figure? Note : There was five episodes planned for this project, but only the first episode was fully completed before production came to a halt in 2010."}
