Of course, it would be more accurate to call her his maid/willing sex slave, since when she isn\u2019t cleaning or making food, he\u2019s showing her all the ways to be a true maid. How should a true maid act you ask? By being sexually subservient and promiscuous of course! She\u2019s not quite there yet though, and Yuusuke\u2019s on a mission to train her to be a true maid, ready and willing to please wherever and whenever he so desires! (Source: Animetric)"}
