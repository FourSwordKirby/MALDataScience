One day, he fell in love at first sight with a transfer student named Takamori Haruka. On that very night, Takamaru and Narika became pursued by a group of mysterious ninja. Just when they thought all hope is lost, Haruka appeared in kunoichi attire. Haruka referred to Takamaru as \"young boss\", and asked him to do H stuff towards her. This gave her superhuman power that enabled her to defeat the mysterious ninjas. However, this was just the beginning of a very long battle. (Source: AlicesoftWiki)"}
