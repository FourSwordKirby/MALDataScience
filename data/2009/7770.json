The three main characters represent the major generations of Japanese; Yutori (teenagers), Tsumekomi (20-30s) and Dankai (middle age). Tsumekomi-chan is an office worker in a toy company and supervises the part-time working student Yutori-chan. She tries to get along with Yutori-chan but her selfish behavior typical of the Yutori generation is incomprehensible."}
