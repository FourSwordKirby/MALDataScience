Now he\u2019s cursed. After incurring the wrath of the great cat guardian, Junpei can suddenly hear what all cats say, and it\u2019s rarely anything nice. To break the curse, Junpei must do 100 good deeds for cats. It doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s allergic to cats, or that his crush Kaede Mizuno loves cats, but is terrible at dealing with them. As he works to atone for breaking the guardian cat statue, he must keep his curse a secret from others or it will grow stronger. He might have a thing for Kaede, but working through this curse makes him more aware of all the other wonderful people (and girls) around him. Guided by his fat cat Nyamusas and joined by a number of catty personalities around his neighborhood, Junpei works towards fulfilling 100 cat wishes, or he is doomed to become a cat himself\uff0da fate which means certain death due to his allergies."}
