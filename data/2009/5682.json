Desperate to escape, the tourist hides in a secluded building. However, Phantom, revealed to be a young woman named Ein, and the leader of Inferno \"Scythe Master\" captures the tourist and brainwashes him. Given the name \"Zwei,\" this once peaceful tourist is now a puppet of Inferno with no memories.
