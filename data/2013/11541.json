Katou (as \"Chief Researcher No. 001\"), Fukuhara (\"Chief Researcher No. 002\"), and a guest star \"researcher\" will ad lib each weekly episode's script entirely from scratch. Animators will then take the ad-libbed dialogue and create footage based on them \u2014 instead of the castmembers voice-acting to existing scripts and footage, as most anime are made.
