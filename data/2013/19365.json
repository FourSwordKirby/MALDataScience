By day, he is superstar model Masayoshi Hazama. By night, he is Samurai Flamenco ! His outfit may be handmade and cheesy, and his fighting skills might be nonexistent, but that doesn\u2019t stop Masayoshi. He\u2019ll clean this city of crime, one misdemeanor at a time\uff0das soon as the bad guys start taking him seriously. Masayoshi might start out as a nobody, but he doesn\u2019t let that stop him. Before he knows it, his vigilante alter-ego has gained the attention of quite a number of people. Joined by good-guy cop Hidenori Goto, a J-pop star trio, an actor and martial artist master, and a motley crew of other characters, Masayoshi lives out his dream of becoming a tokusatsu superhero. But the dream is about to turn into a nightmare. Samurai Flamenco\u2019s crime-fighting ways escalate quickly from preventing littering and petty theft to insane adventures and the fate of the world resting squarely on his costumed shoulders. What makes a true hero? Masayoshi is about to find out.", "Score 6 votes": 4804}
