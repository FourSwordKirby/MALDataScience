He tends to confuse his surroundings beginning with his unique name, but surprisingly his job is upholding law and order as policeman; however, his way of life as modern time policeman leaves his superiors, civilians and even criminals dumbfounded. It's the new type of police comedy the Heisei-era has brought forth. (Source: Translation from NicoNico Douga, edited)", "score_8_votes": 2, "users_watching": 8, "score_2_votes": 0}
