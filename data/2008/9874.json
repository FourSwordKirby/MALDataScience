The only gateway between the two worlds is the Hakurei shrine. Reimu Hakurei is the maiden working at said shrine. Whenever problems of supernatural causes (known as \"Incidents\") occur, Reimu goes out with her friends to investigate, eliminate the cause and hopefully restore Gensokyo to its equilibrium."}
