They shared a kiss before separating for ten years. One fell in love with the other from that day forward. The other grew up and forgot. Nowadays, Shinobu and Momoko attend the same girls' school. They are polar opposites: Momoko enforces decency and order as part of the disciplinary committee, while the delinquent Shinobu collects lovers and failing grades alike. But Shinobu has never truly forgotten the afternoon she and Momoko shared as children. As they and their friends navigate the challenges of schoolwork and schoolgirl crushes, they begin to rediscover their feelings for each other."}
