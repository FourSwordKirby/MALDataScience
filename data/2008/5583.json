Though they succeed in scaring Chip out of his wits, the two can't seem to make Sonic bat an eye at them. Furious, the two band together in order to get the best of Sonic; will he be able to put a stop to the duo with a little help from the full moon?", "score_8_votes": 297, "users_watching": 25, "score_2_votes": 39}
