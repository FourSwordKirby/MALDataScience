Full of despair on the day her fianc\u00e9e returns from abroad to take her away, Sanshiro watches in amazement as Momoyo and her fianc\u00e9e engage in some depraved S&M activities with each other and various members of the house. As time passes, Sanshiro becomes convinced that these bizarre rituals are designed to summon some sort of demon, and he takes it upon himself to stop Momoyo's fianc\u00e9e from destroying the woman he loves.
