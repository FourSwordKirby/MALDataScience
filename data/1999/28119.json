An elderly man goes to the mountains to look for charcoal. There he finds 2 bear cubs which show him where there were delicious autumn chestnuts and mushrooms. He then is able to meet up with the cubs' mother--a bear he once rescued from a bear trap a long time ago. He then helps the family out by giving them some fattening cow's milks so that they will survive the impending winter. The moral of the story is that man and animal should live in symbiosis."}
