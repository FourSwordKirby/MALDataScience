Luckily, they're not alone: each child is paired off with a companion digital monster called a Digimon. Together, the children and their new friends must overcome their insecurities, discover their inner strengths, and evolve into stronger fighters - literally. A force of evil is spreading through the Digital World, corrupting all the Digimon. The DigiDestined have arrived and it\u2019s up to them to save the Digital World, if they ever want to see their home world again.", "score_8_votes": 32518, "users_watching": 4108, "score_2_votes": 228}
