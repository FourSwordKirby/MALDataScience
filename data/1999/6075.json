The strange incidents that happen with this family, which otherwise seems completely ordinary, will make you laugh out loud. The original manga is currently serialized in Takeshobo's Manga Club. The title is a pun on the long running Nippon Animation version of Little Women, \"Ai no Wakakusa Monogatari.\" (Source: AniDB)"}
