In that life, he loved the miko Ayame, though their love was doomed by war. Now, in this life, he is given a prophecy that he will meet the woman of his dreams. Takakage, a college student, has been having strange dreams lately. In them, a young shrine priestess named Ayame promises to marry a young, look-alike soldier named Genshiro the night before he is sent to battle. Takakage finds a maiden who looks like the woman from his dreams. With the help of her, his sister, and his fortune-telling friend, he seeks to find the answers of what their, and his, true origins lay. (Source: ANN)"}
