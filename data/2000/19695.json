We follow the lives and turmoils of seven outcasted 17 year olds and you--the protagonist. Between the aches of being a girl who's younger than her body looks or a boy who'd rather get into fist fights than give handshakes, we found a piece of ourselves within the outcasted teens that's abnormal. Like a four leaf clover. Which are said to bring luck even though it is a mutant in the sea of three leaves. And so the curtain rises to glimpse at these four leaf Clovers--4 boys and 3 girls.
