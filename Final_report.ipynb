    "## Introduction\n",
    "**Anime**, or Japanese Animation, commonly refers to animated television shows which originate from Japan. The medium contains shows spanning a vast number of genres, with shows geared towards children, such as *Pokemon*, to content aimed at young adults, such as *Full Metal Alchemist*. Some titles are produced directly as television original shows, while many others are adaptations of existing source material, such as from Japanese novels, manga (comics), or even games. Anime titles often run for one or two “seasons,” airing one episode a week, totalling to a 13- or 26- episodes “series.” Unlike many American television series, animes are announced upfront that they will only run for one or two season, rather than running until discontinued by the broadcaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MyAnimeList** (abbreviated MAL) is an information database website about anime, much like how *IMDb* is a database for movies. It provides metadata about anime titles, such as synopses, the involved production companies, and genres (e.g. “Action” or “Comedy”). Registred users of MAL can rate and review the animes they’ve watched, which MAL then aggregates into a public score from 1 to 10. As such, MAL serves as a useful indicator of which shows are “good” in the community’s eyes, as well as which shows are “famous.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past years, with the rise of the Internet, the worldwide community of anime watchers grew larger and more defined, while the anime industry became increasingly aware of its audience. Tropes, or patterns in storytelling and character archetypes, developed to fit fan expectations. But as these tropes were reused over many titles, viewers became increasingly wary of “cookie-cutter” shows, many of which ended up forgotten in the mass of “average” shows. In this context, certain animation studios made their claim to fame by either breaking traditions or producing similar shows but of better technical quality. Long time watchers of anime eventually developed a natural intuition for which shows would be “average” or “good” just from the shows’ descriptions and production studios. These notions motivated the idea that there are some underlying trends in the anime medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focused on discovering the underlying patterns of anime and of the anime community by performing data analysis on MAL. We first developed a web scraper which retrieved most of the metadata available on an anime title’s webpage. We then performed data exploration with the purpose of identifying trends within the metadata and exploring relationships between metadata and user scores. We explored trends within each genre, identified patterns within synopsis text, and analyzed the impact of the production studio and source material on popularity. Finally, we addressed the question: “Can we predict the MAL score for an anime title given its metadata?” Our investigation showed that prediction of score is impossible. Instead, we discovered that we can classify which titles are “above average” just from a title’s production studio, genres, source material and length.\n",

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "The scraper we wrote pulled information from all shows that were airing between 1998 to 2015. We did this by iterating through each broadcasting season (winter, spring, summer, fall) between those years and pulling metadata for each anime still airing during that time frame. The information was saved as a JSON, giving each title its own file identified by its MAL ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "User contributions to MAL work as follows. Registered users each have an *AnimeList*, which is an individual profile that allows them to keep track of animes they have seen or plan to watch. Each anime entry added to the list can be labelled as “Completed”, “Watching”, “Plan to Watch”, “On-Hold”, and “Dropped”. Users can score an anime on an integer scale of 1 to 10 if the title is listed as “Completed” or “Watching” on their AnimeList. A page on MAL for an anime title consists of two user aggregates: **score** and **members**. Score is the average of scores users have given a particular title. Members is the total number of users who have added the anime to their AnimeList; this includes titles listed under “Plan to Watch”, “On-Hold”, and “Dropped”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, score represents how “good” an anime is, as judged by MAL users. Members is an approximation for how “famous” a show is. \n",

    "### Initial Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After we collected our data into an organized pandas dataframe, we began the process of exploratory data analysis; where we looked at the various distributions of both the categorical variables and continuous variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process provided necessary insights into the effect the an works genre had on it’s respective score distribution. As depicted by the  histogram below, genres including psychological, shounen, and drama have score distributions that skew  It was evident that towards higher scores compared to genres like kids, where the distribution exhibits a heavy tail of low scores. From this we gathered that the genre was a definitive feature in potentially estimating the expected score of a work. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are most interested in the user score of a given anime, as we gather it's a good metric for the quality of an anime.  The scores follow a unimodal distribution that is roughly normal centered approximately around 7.5 out of 10. This distribution exhibits a tail towards the lower scores, evinced of some low scoring entries pulling down the mean. \n",

    "![\"Score Den  Plot](Rcode/scoreDen.png)\n",

    "This scatter plot matrix illustrates the bivariate relationships among all the continuous variables in the data frame. Where each cell in the matrix is a scatter plot with its x and y vars represented by its position.  One interesting correlation is that longer length in a show seems to imply higher scores. This is likely because companies only invest in producing a movie when they know it will be well received.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our graphic here shows a few interesting points. The major point related to our analysis is that there are a few data points which hit score exactly 0 or 10. This poses the problem that titles with lower number of users ratings can be heavily skewed. We address this in later analysis by using a new “bayes_score” field which normalizes the score to [0.0, 1.0] and adds an additional score of 0 and 1 to balance out the low number of scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In anime context, there are a few curious outlier which have high member count despite low scores. These are School Days and Pupa, which are notoriously violent animes. The incredible violence has drawn much attention despite their lack of substance. In addition, there seems to be a score threshold around 7.0: if an anime does not score at least 7.0, it will never become majorly popular on MAL. Alternatively, if an anime is popular on MAL, it should have a score of at least 7.0."

    "These results were not entirely in line with our personal experience. This is because studios often produce small video animations to advertise their mainline series, and these animations are counted as separate entries on MAL. Many of these are Original Video Animations (OVAs) which are special, unaired single episodes of a title shipped with an anime’s DVD release. These typically score worse than their parent title on MAL since they generally do not advance the parent story’s plot. We decided to filter these short entries out because they do not represent a studio as well as their parent counterparts. We did this by removing all entries that were less than 30 minutes long.\n",

Particularly interesting are the studios which have high average score despite producing more than 5 titles. This indicates consistent quality from a studio, and suggests that an anime’s score can be inferred based on the prestige of the studio making it.\n"

Considering that a scores from 6.7 to 8.0 account for about 45% of all titles, the source material is likely be a telling factor in how well a show is received on MAL.\n",
    "Contextually, we interpret the correlation as follows. Light novels adaptations are highly rated because each novel in a series tells a complete, self-sustaining story which converts well into the short timeframe of 13-episode anime adaptation. These animes usually end with all plot points addressed and without cliffhangers, which leaves viewers satisfied with the anime. Meanwhile, manga adaptations often occur because the source manga is already popular. Thus the anime is also likely to be well received. In contrast, visual novels adaptation tend to suffer because they remove the interactive aspect of the original storytelling game. Moreover, visual novels title typically are not as popular as mangas. Companies only produce these adaptations because the fanbase, although small, is usually dedicated and willing to invest in subsequent merchandise.\n"
